This project focuses on **retail sales optimization** using advanced machine learning techniques.  
We performed **EDA, hypothesis testing, feature engineering, and regression modeling** to understand sales drivers and predict weekly sales across multiple stores and departments.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual storytelling
- Hypothesis Testing for business insights
- Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction
- Regression Models: **Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**
- Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Evaluation
- Business-focused conclusion and recommendations

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Integrated_Retail_Analytics.ipynb` → Main notebook with complete workflow
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
